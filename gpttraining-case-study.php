    <h1>AI Strategy Consultants: Building Brand Awareness and Authority</h1>
    <p>As part of my Master’s program in Digital Marketing, I worked with my team on a consultancy project for gpttraining.ie (now known as aistrategy.ie), a newly launched AI consultancy firm specializing in ChatGPT and GPT-5 solutions.</p>

   <h2>Challenge</h2>
   <p>Being a newly launched site, aistrategy.ie faced:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Very low brand visibility (minimal traffic and keyword rankings)</li>
   <li>No established domain authority or backlink profile</li>
   <li>A knowledge gap in the market regarding GPT training and consultancy services</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The challenge was to create awareness, establish authority, and generate early consultation leads—all within a limited budget and a three-month project window.</p>
   <h2>Strategy</h2>
   <h3>1. Paid Advertising (Google & LinkedIn Ads)</h3>
   <ul>
   <li>Launched Google Display and Search Ads to capture brand visibility and drive top-of-funnel awareness.</li>
   <li>Ran LinkedIn Ads targeting professionals and decision-makers in SMEs, tech firms, and agencies.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>2. Content Marketing & SEO</h3>
   <ul>
   <li>Conducted keyword research and created foundational blog articles aligned with E-E-A-T guidelines.</li>
   <li>Optimized landing pages for ChatGPT consultancy and Custom GPT solutions.</li>
   <li>Designed a link-building strategy including guest posts and non-reciprocal link exchanges.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>3. Analytics & Measurement</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Implemented GA4, Google Tag Manager, and Search Console to measure traffic, CTR, impressions, and conversions.</li>
  <li>Used UTM parameters to track lead generation from ads and blog CTAs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>📈 Ad Reach: Achieved 250K+ impressions across Google and LinkedIn campaigns</li>
</ul>
